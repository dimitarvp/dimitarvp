### Hello. ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ§” I am a super busy programmer with an eye for detail, obsessive about making the code readable almost as if it's English, and always looking into making the code shorter and easier to comprehend (it is much more often read than written after all). Mercilessly practical but never cutting corners either. Automating myself out of the job is my ultimate goal.

ðŸ’¼ Last several years I've focused strictly on backend programming with Elixir and Rust, and I am productive with both. Also very interested in shell scripting and plain old Linux system administration and I do quite okay in both as well.

ðŸ“– Previous experience: C, C++, some x86 Assembly, Java, PHP, Javascript, Ruby (and Ruby on Rails), Go / Golang. **PLEASE NOTE: I am no longer interested in working with any of these for money.** I might make a return to JS and Golang at some point, on my own terms, or for the very occasional consulting. Please don't contact me about any of those above however.

ðŸ‘· I am currently employed and busy, could accept short consultant gigs and/or small one-time jobs over weekends. I am told I coach well so could probably be open to that every now and then.

ðŸ”– Very interested in higher-level math and much stricter and formal languages like Ada, OCaml, Idris, Coq. Not optimistic about ever having time for giving in to these passions but who knows. ðŸ˜ƒ

ðŸ“« Drop me a line anytime. I am a curious person and rarely refuse interesting discussions, be it about programming or anything else.
