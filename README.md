### Hello. ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ§” Programmer with a keen eye for detail, loves making the code readable and maintainable. Pragmatic and never cutting corners. Automating myself out of the job is my ultimate goal.

ðŸ’¼ Focused on backend programming with Elixir, Rust and Golang, know shell scripting and databases. Interested in Linux system administration and network administration and I do well there.

ðŸ“– Previous experience: C, C++, some x86 Assembly, Java, PHP, Javascript, Ruby (plus Ruby on Rails).

ðŸ‘· I am open to many formats of work but have come to appreciate stability and loyalty more than anything else. I am a good and patient coach, and have made money through that, and code reviewing too.

ðŸ”– Keen interest in game bots, financial trading, formal verification of code and super-optimization (compiler tech).

ðŸ“« Drop me a line if you want to talk, I am friendly and curious and don't refuse interesting discussions, be it about programming or anything else.
