### Hello. ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ§” I am a super busy programmer with an eye for detail, loves making the code readable and maintainable. Pragmatic and not cutting corners. Automating myself out of the job is my ultimate goal.

ðŸ’¼ Focused on backend programming with Elixir, Rust and Golang, know shell scripting and some infrastructure. Interested in Linux system administration and network administration and I do well there.

ðŸ“– Previous experience: C, C++, some x86 Assembly, Java, PHP, Javascript, Ruby (plus Ruby on Rails).

ðŸ‘· Usually taking shorter term contracts but if you believe I can be a valuable addition to a long-term team, let's talk, I have done that a lot as well. I am a good and patient coach, and have made money through code reviewing too.

ðŸ”– Interested in higher-level math and much stricter and formal languages like Ada, OCaml, Idris, Coq. Not optimistic about ever having time for giving in to these passions but who knows. ðŸ˜ƒ

ðŸ“« Drop me a line anytime. I am a curious person and rarely refuse interesting discussions, be it about programming or anything else.
